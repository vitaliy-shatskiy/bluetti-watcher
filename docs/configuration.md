# Configuration

The service reads its defaults, then `config.json` in the data directory (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\bluetti-watcher` unless
`--data-dir` or `--config` says otherwise), then the command-line flags. Keys are camelCase and case-sensitive (`MAC`
is not `mac`; the installer refuses it too); comments (`//`) are allowed; a key left out keeps its default. A change takes effect at the next start of the service
(`Stop-ScheduledTask BluettiWatcher; Start-ScheduledTask BluettiWatcher`).

The rules these values feed are in [design.md](design.md).

## Minimal example

```json
{
  "mac": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
}
```

`mac` is the station's Bluetooth address (the BLUETTI app or Windows Bluetooth settings show it). Without it the
service starts, serves the page and `/api/health` with a problem naming the missing `mac`, and polls nothing.

## Full example

Every key with its default, except `mac`, `actions` and the DTEK address, which have none.

`<exe dir>` and `%LOCALAPPDATA%` above stand for the real paths: write an absolute path in a real file, or leave the
key out for its default. JSON strings need `\\` for each backslash.

## Station

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mac` | string | none (required) | The station's Bluetooth address, `AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`. A model only the cloud reads (below) needs none. |
| `type` | string | `AC200PL` | The model, as BLUETTI names it; also matched against the cloud's device model. Bluetooth reads 29 models: the IoT V1 models AC200L, AC200M, AC200PL, AC300, AC500, EB3A, EP500, EP500P (the AC300 without its battery packs) and the IoT V2 models AC2A, AC2P, AC50B, AC60, AC60P, AC70, AC70P, AC180, AC180T, AC180P, AP300, EL10, EL30V2, EL100V2, EP600, EP760, EP800, EP2000, Handsfree 1, PR30V2, PR100V2 (the EP600, EP760, EP800 and EP2000 report the battery level only, no mains state: they are a missed reading over Bluetooth, and the cloud fallback answers); read only: Modbus function 0x03 under register 2000. A model with no output-mode register (every V2 model and the EB3A) gets the mode derived from the AC powers, as the cloud reading does: AC input above 0 W = `BLE_MAINS`, 0 W with AC output above 0 W = `INVERTER_OUTPUT`. A station that encrypts its Bluetooth link is a missed reading, not connected to again until the service restarts, and the cloud fallback answers. Any other model (an unknown name) is read through the cloud fallback alone when it is on; without it, it is reported in `/api/health` `problem` and nothing is polled, as is a `mac` that is not a Bluetooth address. |

Since 1.1.0 the Python reader's keys `bleBackend` and `readerPath` (and the flag `--reader`) are ignored: an old
config.json still loads, and `service.log` names them once at start.
| `capacityWh` | number | 2304 | Battery capacity, Wh, for the battery-time formula. |
| `efficiency` | number | 0.85 | Inverter efficiency for the formula, until a learned value exists. |

## Polling and readings

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pollSec` | int | 60 | Seconds between readings. |
| `fastPollSec` | int | 60 | Seconds between readings on battery under `fastBelow`. |
| `fastBelow` | number | 25 | Battery percent under which `fastPollSec` applies. |
| `readerTimeoutSec` | int | 30 | Time limit of one Bluetooth read (connect, every request, disconnect); a Bluetooth call that does not return is given up 2 s after it. |
| `maxGapSec` | int | 600 | A gap between accepted readings over this resets the decision state. |
| `socRatePerMin` | number | 5 | Largest plausible SOC change, points per minute. |
| `socJumpFloor` | number | 3 | The allowed SOC change is never under this many points. |
| `jumpWindowSec` | int | 120 | A reading accepted after a silence that jumps more than the rate allows over this many seconds counts as a rebase for hibernate. |
| `silentAfter` | int | 3 | Misses in a row before the station is reported silent. |

## Mains and battery levels

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mainsLostSec` | int | 180 | No AC input this long -> the cut begins, eco on. |
| `mainsBackSec` | int | 180 | AC input held this long -> every mode lifted. |
| `emergencyAt` | number | 20 | Percent: station emergency. |
| `stopAt` | number | 10 | Percent: stop (the flag's level says critical). |
| `warnAt` | number | 7 | Percent: hibernate warning. |
| `hibernateAt` | number | 5 | Percent: the PC hibernates. |
| `agreeSec` | int | 90 | Two agreeing readings at least this far apart confirm a level. |
| `hibernateAfterWarnSec` | int | 180 | Hibernate waits at least this long after the warning. |
| `rebaseHibernateConfirmSec` | int | 600 | After a rebase in the cut, hibernate needs this long at or under `hibernateAt`. |
| `batteryRefreshSec` | int | 600 | On battery, the reading goes into the flag at least this often. |

## Battery time

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rateWindowMin` | int | 60 | Minutes of readings off mains the measured discharge rate looks back over. |
| `rateMinDrop` | number | 3 | Least SOC drop, points, the measured rate needs. |
| `rateMinSpanMin` | int | 20 | Least span, minutes, the measured rate needs. |

## Power mode and actions

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `powerMode.script` | string | not set | Not set: the service runs the power-mode switch in its own process (`BluettiWatcher.exe power-mode`). Set: that script, through `pwshPath`, instead. |
| `powerMode.flagPath` | string | `%ProgramData%\BluettiWatcher\power-mode.json` | The flag file; passed to the switch as `-Path` and `POWER_MODE_FILE`. |
| `powerMode.mutex` | string | `Local\BluettiWatcherPowerMode` | The named mutex guarding the flag; passed as `POWER_MODE_MUTEX`. |
| `powerMode.taskPrefix` | string | `BluettiWatcherEco` | Prefix of the switch's scheduled tasks (`<prefix>End`, `<prefix>GpuCap`, `<prefix>GpuRestore`); passed as `POWER_MODE_TASK_PREFIX`. |
| `powerMode.extraReaders` | string[] | `[]` | Local accounts allowed to read the flag folder besides the user, SYSTEM and Administrators (e.g. a service that shows the mode); passed as `POWER_MODE_EXTRA_READERS`, comma-joined. Each name `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ . - space`, 1-64 chars; an invalid one is reported in `/api/health` `problem` and none are passed. |
| `flagPath` | string | - | Older name of `powerMode.flagPath`; still read. |
| `pwshPath` | string | `pwsh.exe` | PowerShell 7 used to run the wake-task commands and a configured `powerMode.script`. |
| `powerModeTimeoutSec` | int | 60 | 1-600: time limit of each power-mode command and each wake-task command. A command over it is killed and counts as failed. |
| `actionTimeoutSec` | int | 30 | 1-600: time limit of each action (only actions). |
| `actions` | object | none | Commands run when the service enters a state: keys `eco`, `emergency`, `stop`, `hibernate-warn`, `normal`. See below. |
| `dryRun` | bool | false | Log every power-mode command, action and hibernation instead of running it (also `--dry-run`). |

An action is an executable followed by its arguments, started directly with no shell: a pipe, a redirect or a shell
built-in needs `cmd /c ...`. It runs windowless, with the environment values `POWER_MODE_FILE`, `POWER_MODE_MUTEX`,
`POWER_MODE_TASK_PREFIX` and `POWER_MODE_EXTRA_READERS` set, within `actionTimeoutSec`. Its exit code and the first 300 characters of its output are
logged as an event; a missing, failing or hanging command never changes a decision. It fires once per entry into a
state per power cut (the next cut fires again; `normal` fires once per lift). The page's Eco fires `eco`; its Max and
Auto-lift fire `normal`. A dry run logs the actions and their environment instead of running them.

A flag path set while `powerMode.mutex` is left at its default is reported at start (log and event `config-warning`):
set both, or neither.

Hibernation off: create an empty file `no-hibernate` in the data directory. It is read on every poll.

## Wake during a cut

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wakeEveryMinutes` | int | 0 | 10-1440: a hibernation during a cut arms the wake task this many minutes ahead. 0 = off. Turn it on only after the check in the README passes. |
| `wakeReadSec` | int | 300 | 60-3600: woken by the timer with no accepted reading for this long, the PC hibernates again. |
| `wakeFloorPercent` | number or null | null | At or under this percent no wake is armed. null = `hibernateAt` - 5 (at least 0); bounded to 0..`hibernateAt`; 0 = no floor. |
| `wakeTaskName` | string | `BluettiWatcherWake` | The wake task `install.ps1` registers: 1-100 characters of letters, digits, space, `.`, `_`, `-`; never `BluettiWatcher` (the service's own task). A task of that name that is not the wake task the installer registers is never replaced or removed. |

## Cloud fallback

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cloudEnabled` | bool or null | null | null = on when the token file exists at start; `true` on; `false` off. |
| `cloudTokenPath` | string or null | null | The token file; null = `cloud-token.json` in the data directory. `BluettiWatcher.exe --cloud-login` writes it. |
| `staleLoadW` | number | 100 | A cloud reading off mains with at least this AC load whose SOC has not moved for `staleAfterMin` is stale (a miss). |
| `staleAfterMin` | int | 30 | Minutes for the stale check; 0 or less = no check. |

## Service

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `port` | int | 18940 | HTTP port on 127.0.0.1 (also `--port`). |
| `lockWaitSec` | int | 30 | 0-600: a start waits this long for an older instance to release the port's lock. |
| `dataDir` | string | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bluetti-watcher` | Database, log, config and kill switch (also `--data-dir`). |
| `rawRetentionDays` | int | 30 | Raw minute rows kept this long, then folded into 5-minute aggregates. |
| `trimWorkingSet` | bool | true | After each poll the process's pages leave its working set, so the Task Manager "Memory" column (private working set) drops under 1 MB after each poll (an open page raises it again until the next one). Cosmetic: commit (private bytes) does not change, and the pages fault back in at the next poll (from RAM while Windows keeps them on its standby list). `false` keeps them. |

## DTEK module (`dtekWatcher`)

Off by default; it makes no request while off. `null` = off.

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | bool | false | Turns the module on. |
| `queues` | string[] | none | The house's queues, such as `GPV1.1`. Without them (and with `site` off) the module cannot tell which queue is yours. |
| `group` | string, string[] or null | null | The queue to follow, a hint real cuts can refute; an array = a set whose planned outage is the union (at most 4). |
| `datasetUrl` | string | the Baskerville42/outage-data-ua Kyiv region file | Primary schedule source; must be plain https. |
| `staleAfterMin` | int | 90 | The schedule is stale when its newest collection is older. |
| `minCutMin` | int | 15 | A cut shorter than this many minutes is a blip: it counts in no DTEK statistic (the "usually back N min before/after the plan" median, the queue search, the manual queue's hint); it stays on the chart and in the cut history. 0 = every cut counts; a cut of exactly this length counts. 0 to 1440, else the module is off with the reason. |
| `site` | bool | false | Opt-in. false = the distributor's site is never asked; only the public dataset is read. true = the watcher also reads the distributor's website the way a browser does, which picks up plan edits sooner and, with `city`, `street` and `house`, names the house's queues. Use of the site is subject to its own terms; you turn it on at your own responsibility. |
| `host` | string | `www.dtek-krem.com.ua` | The site's host; with the dataset's, the only hosts a request may go to. |
| `city`, `street`, `house` | string | "" | Optional address, sent to the site only, to learn the house's queues and current outage. |

## Command line

`BluettiWatcher.exe [--config <file>] [--data-dir <dir>] [--port <n>] [--flag <file>] [--power-mode <power-mode.ps1>]
[--dry-run]` - flags override config.json. `--flag` sets `powerMode.flagPath`,
`--power-mode` sets `powerMode.script`.

`BluettiWatcher.exe --cloud-login [--data-dir <dir>]` - signs in to the BLUETTI cloud in the browser and writes the
token file, then exits. An answer without a valid `expires_in` is refused and nothing is written.

`BluettiWatcher.exe --help` (`-h`, `/?`) prints the usage and `--version` prints `Bluetti Watcher <version>`; both exit 0
and win over every other word on the line (`--cloud-login --help` only prints the usage). A flag that takes a value
refuses a missing value or one that starts with `--`; an unknown flag or word prints a message and exits 2. The exe has no
console of its own: these commands print into the terminal they were started from (nothing, when started by the logon
task). PowerShell does not wait for such an exe, so `$LASTEXITCODE` is not set after a plain `& .\BluettiWatcher.exe`;
pipe it (`& .\BluettiWatcher.exe --help | Out-Host`) or use `Start-Process -NoNewWindow -Wait -PassThru`.

## Environment of the power-mode scripts

`power-mode/*.ps1` read `POWER_MODE_FILE`, `POWER_MODE_MUTEX`, `POWER_MODE_TASK_PREFIX` and `POWER_MODE_EXTRA_READERS`,
with the defaults above (no extra readers). The service sets all four from `powerMode` for every child it starts; set them yourself when you run the scripts by
hand with non-default names.

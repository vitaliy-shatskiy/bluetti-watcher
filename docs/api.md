# HTTP API

The service listens on `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` (port 18940 by default) and nowhere else. Answers are JSON (UTF-8)
unless noted. Times are ISO 8601 with the PC's local offset (`2026-01-31T18:05:00+02:00`); query times may be ISO 8601
or Unix milliseconds.

## Guard

- Every request: the `Host` header must be exactly `127.0.0.1:<port>` or `localhost:<port>`; anything else is `403
  forbidden: foreign Host`. This blocks DNS rebinding.
- `POST /api/mode` also needs the header `X-Station: 1` and an `Origin` that is absent or the service's own
  (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>` or `http://localhost:<port>`); else 403 with the reason. A web page on another origin
  cannot send the custom header without a CORS preflight, and the service never sends a CORS header.
- Wrong method: 405 (`POST only` for `/api/mode`, `GET only` elsewhere). Unknown path: 404.

## GET /

| `planChanges` | Plan edits seen during this cut (0 outside a cut). |
| `lateBackMin`, `lateCuts` | Median minutes the power came back after the plan (null under 3 recorded cuts), and the cuts recorded. |
| `today`, `tomorrow` | Dates `DD.MM.YYYY` (Kyiv). |
| `windows` | Per shown queue: `queue`, `today`, `tomorrow` (text such as `17:00-21:00, possible 21:00-22:00`, `no cuts`, or ""), `intervals` (`start`, `end`, `queues`). |

## GET /api/history?from&to&step

Stored readings. `to` defaults to now, `from` to 26 hours before `to`; `step` seconds, default 60. A step of 60 or
less returns each stored row (raw minutes, and 5-minute aggregates for older times); a larger step groups them.

```json
{ "step": 60, "rows": [ { "at": "...", "soc": 87, "inAc": 0, "inDc": 0, "outAc": 142, "outDc": 0, "volt": 52.1, "hz": 50.0, "mains": false } ] }
```

400 when a time cannot be read, `step` < 1 or `from` >= `to`.

## GET /api/events?from&to

Stored events, same time defaults: `{ "events": [ { "at", "kind", "detail" } ] }`. Kinds include `eco-on`,
`emergency-on`, `mains-back`, `stop`, `hibernate-warning`, `hibernate`, `hibernate-refused`, `hibernate-skipped`,
`hibernate-delayed`, `mode-dropped`, `mode-refused`, action failures, `wake-*` and `dtek-watcher-*`.

## GET /api/health

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | true when `problem` is null; false while a problem is set (for example when `mac` is missing). |
| `problem` | What keeps the service from working (for example the missing `mac`), or null. |
| `version` | The service version. |
| `uptimeSec` | Seconds since start. |
| `dryRun` | true in a dry run. |
| `lastPollAt`, `lastAcceptedAt` | Times of the last poll and the last accepted reading, or null. |
| `lastSource` | `bluetooth` or `cloud`: the source of the last accepted reading, or null. |
| `bluetoothEncrypted` | true once the station opened the encrypted Bluetooth handshake: the built-in reader reads unencrypted stations only, so it is not connected to again until the service restarts and the cloud fallback answers. Information, not a problem: `ok` does not change. false otherwise. |
| `bluetoothStalled` | true while a Bluetooth read abandoned at `readerTimeoutSec` plus 2 s (a Bluetooth call that ignored its timeout) is still running: no new Bluetooth read starts and the cloud fallback answers, until it ends or, after max(4 x that bound, 2 minutes), is given up. Information, not a problem: `ok` does not change. false otherwise. |
| `misses` | Misses in a row. |
| `silent` | true while the station does not answer. |
| `rawRows`, `aggregateRows` | Rows in the database. |

## POST /api/mode

Body `{"mode": "auto" | "eco" | "max"}`, headers per the guard above.

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://127.0.0.1:18940/api/mode -Headers @{ 'X-Station' = '1' } -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{"mode":"eco"}'
```

The page's Eco fires the `eco` action and Max (or Auto lifting the page's Eco) fires `normal`, when `actions` define
them: an executable with arguments, no shell, logged only in a dry run ([configuration.md](configuration.md), "Power
mode and actions"; the power-mode commands have their own limit, `powerModeTimeoutSec`).

Answer: `{ "ok", "accepted", "manual", "message", "code" }`. 202 = saved; the service loop applies it. 409 = Max refused
during a battery emergency (`code` names it). 400 = a body that is not JSON or a mode that is not one of the three.
